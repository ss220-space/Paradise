/**
 * ## Flex
 * Quickly manage the layout, alignment, and sizing of grid columns, navigation,
 * components, and more with a full suite of responsive flexbox utilities.
 *
 * If you are new to or unfamiliar with flexbox, we encourage you to read this
 * [CSS-Tricks flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
 *
 * Consists of two elements: `<Flex>` and `<Flex.Item>`. Both of them provide
 * the most straight-forward mapping to flex CSS properties as possible.
 *
 * One of the most basic usage of flex, is to align certain elements
 * to the left, and certain elements to the right:
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <Flex>
 *   <Flex.Item grow>Button description</Flex.Item>
 *   <Flex.Item>
 *     <Button>Perform an action</Button>
 *   </Flex.Item>
 * </Flex>
 * ```
 *
 * Flex item with `grow` property will grow to take all available empty space,
 * while flex items without grow will take the minimum amount of space. This
 * effectively places the last flex item to the very end of the flex container.
 *
 * @deprecated - Use
 * [Stack](https://github.com/tgstation/tgui-core/tree/main/lib/components/Stack.tsx)
 * where possible.
