	I see the same nightmare every month, if not every week right now... The darkness, the silence, blood.. DOOM! Our brave RnD created a hell engine.  \
	On its born in CZ, I swear, I heard our names whispered from the void! This thing WAS THE VOID, THE BLACK HOLE ITSELF!  \
	First - a 10 cm lead container appears in Alpha Engineering Foyer, next - executive man and head of our department Chief Engineer Jakob T. -  \
	asking Captain about soon retirement! Then this RnD with their secret engine project come with shtamped papers and told us to force works on building containment zone as soon as possible  \
	for their precious reports to CC about successful success in the field of energy production. We didn't know yet what was inside that container, and I HAD TO BE more clever that days...  \
	<p>We built everything as it was on plans. Every wire, every rod - everything were in the place, it has to be safe! Actually, I decided to not risk with possible malfunctions and requested more equipment from RnD,  \
	and they sent everything I asked without a question! Like they were not sure themself about safety of this monster. We doubled emitters, made another SMES, even P.A.C.M.A.N.'s if shits went wrong.  \
	And at the end even this wasn't enough.<p>At the very start - all our consoles and sensors on Alpha blackedout. Radio silenced. The fields went down. I heard as something rattle and rumble inside Alpha..  \
	Or it was everywhere? Ten seconds later Alpha got hit via something big. As I will know later it was arriving Cargo supply shuttle from CC requested 2 weeks ago. Half of Cargo department was crushed down,  \
	couple staff members died in a seconds, in space and under the drifting shuttle, seven more were hardly injured. Screams and darkness.. The Singularity were stay in place quiet and peacefully,  \
	we managed turn off accelerator before it let Singulo grew up and let it swallow all of us and the station. Barely didn't crapped myself when I saw pulsations of the Void myself,  \
	I thought we are gone.. And Im not sure, I heard something..  laughing?.. and.. names.. it was our names.. from everywhere and nowhere at the same time.  \
	I decided it was an effect from high radiation splash of Singulo born and went to check SMES, my good bud Alfred.. he could become good or even excelent CE after all Im sure!  \
	Poor guy.. went outside to check why the fields and emitters turned off. The others went fix Alpha breaches and power it back. We work for a hour and half.  \
	I just came back to the consoles as one of engineers covered in blood and burned suit and face, siezed and shout at me about Alfred - he were flying toward this..  \
	thing.. openwide his arms. Radio came back, he giggles and mumbles. I ran outside screaming into channel to stop. In the last seconds hes finally heard me...  \
	His blood sprayed across whole area, covering fields, walls, windows, airlocks.. my whole RIG - I heard his twitched scream and it stunned me to deaf.  \
	The Void consumed its prey, grew up and moved...<p>I don't remember how I survived all what happened after. Almost whole Alpha gone in embrace of the Singulo.  \
	I don't know how we get rid off it eather. CC sent us Engineering ERT to fix station, more than a half of the station crew asked about evac,  \
	I decided to stay and repair station with CCs guys. I'll never forget that. Now seven month later after the incident, Engineering accepted fax from new Research Director -  \
	they created 'ANOTHER VOID ENGINE. MORE STABLE THAN BEFORE'! It was the last straw of me, I left my job and wrote the note. Never setup this engine.  \
	If from the first look you didn't feel afraid of anything in that doom-device, I hope my story will ensure you that you SHOULD. I warned you."

	20-25 years ago perfectly saved its internal organs under the half transperent elastic skin, like if its death happened couple minutes ago. Inside we traced low electrical activity in  \
	body and the center of it was this core. The Research Director searched any data about the xeno form in all available xeno databases he requested from CC Science Data Centers.  \
	He got fax from CC later which in they asked to continue researches manually since we have enough samples of these xeno by using all spectrum of chemicals we can afford to spend on them.  \
	<br /><br /><br />Chemical reaction records and notes<br /><br />All chemicals used without syringe insertion outside the core, be it gas or liquid of powder during highing or lowering temperature did no results at all.  \
	Researche continues.<br /><br />Note 1: One of our scientists noted that core starts hit him with static electricity and fluctuate after he accidently touched it with his skin when he weared off his latex glowes.  \
	He used regular distilled water on core to see if its connected somehow with special liquids. The result wasn't much remarkable but still, the core just fluctuated and the effect were less intensive than it was before...  \
	<br /><br />Most inserted chemicals did no reactions. The only reagent was water, the core mixed water with inner liquid and changed the color. Chemical compounds we extracted back in closer look simulates one of pharmacological drugs in Medicine called Epinephrine.  \
	At least the good news. Report sent<br /><br />Our management requested new chemicals and one of them very expensive - Plasma, solid and gas. I personaly sure it will give us what we waiting from the cores.  \
	Chemical analysis shows that reagents close to Plasma parameters are most effective rise electrical activity inside. It should be the answer."
