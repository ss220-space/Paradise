You can change orders for z-level(from 3 to last cause centcom and admin are compiled right into) and everything shouldn't break
If something breaks due to z order change, it means it's hardcoded and then it means someone fucked up in coding.

2024-06-18, the typical z-levels for a single-level station are:
1: CentCom
2: Admin Zone
3: Station
4: Mining
5: Taipan
6: Away mission
7-11: Randomized space
last: Transit
